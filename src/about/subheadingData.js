            Hi, I’m Monica Gikaru! I recently completed the SheCodes Bootcamp, I
            enjoy bringing designs to life with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
            I’m always curious to learn new tools that make the web more
            creative and accessible. Right now, I’m excited to take the next
            step in my journey by joining a team where I can keep growing as a
            developer and contribute to meaningful projects.
